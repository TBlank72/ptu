Working in the fitness industry can be a lucrative and rewarding career.  However, the U.S. Job market isn't looking so good in 2016 and experts are predicting it could get worse. [CNN Money][CNN] reported on Friday that there have been more than 191,000 job loses in energy and mining sectors since 2014. These layoffs have an impact on other industries; so, how strong is the fitness job market?

Careers in the fitness industry are expected to continue to grow faster over the next 8 years compared to other industries. The latest [Bureau of Labor Statistics][BLS] reports showed that employment in the personal training and fitness industries will grow by 8% between 2014 and 2024.

According to other data, we'll see why this is probably an underestimate.

## Consumer Interest in Fitness

While, personal trainers see health and fitness as a top priority, the fact is that it doesn't matter how important we think it is. For an individual to pay for personal training services, they must see greater value in the personal training services they are receiving than they do in the money they are spending to receive the services. Anyone that has experience in a personal training management or sales position can tell you that the house payment, car payment, utility bills, and grocery bills always come before personal training. That doesn't mean that personal training is just for rich or wealthy people; personal training just tends be the last thing people add to their budget and the first thing they cut from the budget.

We can get some idea of the status of the fitness job market by taking a look at what people are interested in on Google trends.  

![Google Trends - People are more interested in fitness than money when there is plenty of money to go around](https://googledrive.com/host/0B_wpLFZ54MdKR3BNSHBHYlAwMHM/google-trends-1.jpg)

You can see that, since the 2008 financial collapse, fitness has gradually trended further above finances (at least according to [Google Search Trends][goog]).

## What About Actual Personal Training Jobs?

In 2015 [Reviews.com][reviews] rated the top three job search engines:
1. [indeed.com][indeed]
2. [linkup.com][LU]
3. [simplyhired.com][SH]

[Indeed][indeed] has a really cool **[job trends][indeed]** feature that a lot of people don't know about. You can compare any search term and compare absolute and relative comparisons of actual job postings that contain those search terms.  Take a look at what we recently pulled up with a quick search comparing popular careers.

Keep in mind, the graph above is a relative comparison, not absolute.  Still, it shows that fitness jobs are increasing faster compared to the others.  Actually, the other markets are losing jobs.  Another thing to notice is that group exercise jobs are falling along with the others in the comparison, so tell your groupX instructors to get a PT cert as back-up insurance policy if they're relying on the income.  

## Personal Training Job Security

You don't need to look at a lot of data to realize that Americans continue to gain weight year after year. What's scary is that it's not even normal to have a normal BMI.  It's much more common to be obese or overweight than to be of normal weight.

{% callout info %}
#### {% fa info-circle %} Centers for Disease Control Statistics (2013-2014)
| Weight Status | % of Sample | Sample Size |
| ------------- | :---------: | :---------: |
| Obese Adults  | 28.9% | 425,875 |
| Overweight Adults | 35.2% | 425,875 |
| Obese Adolescents | 13.7% | 12,580 |
| Overweight Adolescents | 16.6% | 12,580 |
**That's 64.1% of all adults that are either overweight or obese.** What's even scarier is that 30.3% of children in the U.S. are considered overweight/obese.
{% endcallout %}
Based on the [CDC][CDC] data, we can safely assume, we will have a need for personal trainers, and fitness professionals in general, for foreseeable future.

## More Job Security for the Future

[Bariatric-surgury-source][bar] reported that childhood obesity had risen from 4.5% in 1963 to 17% in 2007-2008. And that doesn't include kids that were overweight, only those classified as obese. In fact, until recently there wasn't a classification system for overweight/obese children. 

![Childhood Obesity Trends, 1963-2008](https://googledrive.com/host/0B_wpLFZ54MdKR3BNSHBHYlAwMHM/child-obesity1.gif)

We were doing pretty good until the 1970's and it's continued to get worse every year since. Are we really that much lazier? Well, the causes of obesity are outside the scope of this article, but technology, availability of food, processed foods, etc. have something to do with it. BTW, high fructose corn syrup was introduced in the 1970's.

## Restaurant Profits will Keep Personal Trainers in Business

![Restaurant Industry Sales Growth](https://googledrive.com/host/0B_wpLFZ54MdKR3BNSHBHYlAwMHM/restaurant-industry-trend1.jpg)

Greater profits in the food and beverage industries trend closely with the rise in obesity prevelance. It's unlikely we'll see either trend turning around anytime soon. So, yeah the job forecast looks pretty good for personal trainers.
