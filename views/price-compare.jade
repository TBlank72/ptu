      h3.orange How are PT University's prices so low?
      p.
        We don't think a personal trainer's resume and marketability should
        be limited by their bank account and socioeconomic status. From the
        beginning, PT University has made providing fitness certifications 
        that anyone can afford a primary focus of our business.  We are able 
        to offer the most competitive pricing model in the fitness industry by
        limiting our expenses in a few key ways:
      ol
        li
          p.
            <strong>We don't send paper copies through the mail.</strong> 
            Postage, paper, ink, printers, copiers, etc. cost a lot of money. Our 
            expenses for paper are essentially zero! 
            #[a(href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/", target='_blank', class="green link-blue-hov") Go Green].
        li
          p.
            <strong>We don't pay for advertising.</strong> Our only advertising
            is word of mouth from satisfied customers.
        li
          p.
            <strong>We don't offer live testing</strong>.  We don't have live 
            seminars, classes, testing centers, instructor salaries, etc.
            100% of our testing is online.
        //li
          p.
            <strong>Donations.</strong> We accept small donations from
            those that would like to help the cause. Most donations we receive
            are less than $10. If you would like to help support PT University,
            feel free to throw a few bucks our way. If not, we completely
            understand.
